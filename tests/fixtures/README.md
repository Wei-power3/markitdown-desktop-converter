## Adding Test Documents

### For PDF files:
```bash
# Place PDF files in tests/fixtures/sample_pdfs/
cp /path/to/TIM-HF3-fcvm-11-1457995.pdf tests/fixtures/sample_pdfs/
cp /path/to/heart_failure_disease_management_program__a_review.17.pdf tests/fixtures/sample_pdfs/
cp /path/to/Boston-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference-2025.pdf tests/fixtures/sample_pdfs/
```

### For PowerPoint files:
```bash
# Place PPTX files in tests/fixtures/sample_pptx/
cp /path/to/presentation.pptx tests/fixtures/sample_pptx/
```

## Expected Outputs

The `expected_outputs/` directory contains baseline markdown files generated by v2.2.1 for regression testing.

These files are generated by:
```bash
python tests/regression/generate_baseline.py
```

## Quality Benchmarks

Expected quality scores for test documents (v2.2.1 baseline):

| Document | Text Quality | Structure Score | Overall Score |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| TIM-HF3 | 85-90% | 70-80% | 80-85% |
| Heart Failure Review | 90-95% | 75-85% | 85-90% |
| Boston Presentation | 90-95% | 70-80% | 82-88% |

## Known Artifacts to Test

### Ligature Issues (should be fixed):
- "arti fi cial" → "artificial"
- "identi fi cation" → "identification"
- "con fi dence" → "confidence"

### Medical Terms (should be preserved):
- NT-proBNP
- MR-proADM
- β-blockers
- HbA1c

### Internal Links (should NOT appear):
- ❌ [the](#page-7) - Internal link pollution
- ❌ [and](#page-5) - Common word pollution
- ✅ [website](https://example.com) - External links OK

## Git Handling

PDF and PPTX files are treated as binary:
```gitattributes
*.pdf binary
*.pptx binary
*.doc binary
*.docx binary
```

Large files (>5MB) should use Git LFS if repository size becomes an issue.
